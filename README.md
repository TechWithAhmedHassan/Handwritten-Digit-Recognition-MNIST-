# 🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

A machine learning project to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST dataset**. The model learns to recognize patterns in pixel values and predicts the correct digit with high accuracy.

---

## 📌 Dataset  
The project uses the **MNIST dataset**, which contains:
- **60,000** training images  
- **10,000** testing images  
- Each image is **28x28 pixels** (grayscale)  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing of image data (scaling, reshaping, normalization)  
- Model training using different approaches (Logistic Regression / Neural Networks / CNN)  
- Evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics  
- Visualization of predictions with sample test images  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML models)  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for deep learning)  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **97% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
- Model generalizes well to unseen handwritten digits.
